    <p>
      I'm a passionate full stack developer who thrives on solving tough technical challenges.
      With over six years of experience working across multiple departments in a Fortune 100 environment,
      I’ve modernized legacy systems, built applications from scratch, and helped drive secure, scalable,
      cloud-based solutions. I take pride in my ability to quickly understand new tools, adapt to evolving
      tech stacks, and deliver clean, maintainable code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently looking to transition from a contract position to a full-time role where I can continue
      solving meaningful problems, contribute to impactful projects, and grow with a team that values ownership and innovation.
